              Hello, I'm Jeneel Farrell, a sophomore computer science student at
              Howard University. My journey into the world of technology began
              with a curiosity that has evolved into a passion for coding and
              problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a strong foundation in web development, with proficiency in
              JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, allowing me to design and create
              interactive and visually appealing websites. Additionally, I have
              experience in Python, a versatile language I've used for various
              projects and problem-solving tasks. My educational journey at
              Howard University has provided me with a solid grounding in
              computer science principles, and I'm continually expanding my
              skill set.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am enthusiastic about creating web applications and contributing
              to the open-source community. I'm excited about the opportunities
              that lie ahead and am eager to explore new challenges and
              collaborations within the world of computer science. Thank you for
              visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with
              fellow tech enthusiasts and professionals as we navigate the
              ever-evolving landscape of technology.
            </p>
